Localisation:

To localize this website,
1. Create new directory for your locale in application/languages/, system/languages/, application/views/ and translating all files
   CodeIginter will spit error if any of the file is missing.
   you might want to copy system/languages/english if you don't want to translate them; they don't really show often.
2. $cfg['language'] change application/config/config.php to your language.
3. Some of the paramaters in application/config/gfx.php are locale-related. Do remember to change them.
4. You might want to tweak style.css and some images, especially if the locale is RTL.
Note that localisation only affects appearence, not dynamatic content;
it's not pratical to preapre concentrate all locale to a huge table, nor possible to fetch amo content of every locale.
(this means it's safe to delete all other locale files if you don't need them)

Known Issue:
1. If your protect your setup with HTTP password (which may be seted in .htaccess),
   the following will break:
   * Avatar upload (due to inability of Flash plugin to share session with the browser)
   * OpenID 2.0 xrds authorization (the one that suppress Yahoo! login warning)
2. Login into https openids will fail if your php-curl unable to get local issuer certificate,
   you can try to verify that by wget the same https url, wget will complain the same thing.
   On a ubuntu, you should install "ca-certificates" package.
