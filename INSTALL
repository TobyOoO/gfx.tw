Enviroment:
* apache2 mod_rewrite php5(?)
* lighttpd should be ok but you have to set up rewrite rule yourself.
* writable /tmp (can be changed at application/config/openid.php
* MySQL > 4.1 with fulltext search ability.
  * You Must turn ft_min_word_len =1 in order to search Chinese characters.
  To do so, drop this file as /etc/mysql/conf.d/fulltext.cnf
{

[mysqld]
# enable chinese search
ft_min_word_len =1

}

Install:
1. Check out code from svn
2. Config base path at application/config/config.php and .htaccess, and various config at application/config/gfx.php
3. Config db at application/config/database.php
4. Create database and table structures by importing gfx.sql
5. Create inital user at table `users`, feature selections at `features` and group selections `groups`
6. sudo chown www-data:www-data useravatars system/cache userstickers (or chmod 777 if you cannot sudo)

On Production Site:
1. Change $route['scaffolding_trigger']  to empty string in application/config/routes.php
2. Change error_reporting(E_ALL) to error_reporting(E_ERROR) in ./index.php

Localisation:

To localize this website,
1. Create new directory for your locale in application/languages/, system/languages/, application/views/ and translating all files
   CodeIginter will spit error if any of the file is missing.
   you might want to copy system/languages/english if you don't want to translate them; they don't really shows often.
2. $cfg['language'] change application/config/config.php to your language.
3. Some of the paramaters in application/config/gfx.php are locale-related. Do remember to change them.
4. You might want to tweak style.css and some images, especially if the locale is RTL.
Note that localisation only affects appearence, not dynamatic content;
it's not pratical to preapre concentrate all locale to a huge table, nor possible to fetch amo content of every locale.
(this means it's safe to delete all other locale files if you don't need them)

Known Issue:
If your protect your setup with HTTP password (which may be seted in .htaccess),
the following will break:
* Avatar upload (due to inability of Flash plugin to share session with the browser)
* OpenID 2.0 xrds authorization (the one that suppress Yahoo! login warning)
